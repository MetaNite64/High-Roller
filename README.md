# High Roller ~ a new "Dice" consumable type for Balatro

This mod introduces Dice, a new consumable type that is centralized around short-term boosts (often only for a single hand). It also comes with a hidden Spectral card that can appear in the new Dice Bags, a new Voucher set that makes Dice better, and 4 Jokers that interact with Dice.

Current status: HEAVY WIP
- code is pretty much done! there are probably some timings to adjust, and when art is done there needs to be some extra sprite coding shenanigans done for the dice cards themselves, but that shouldn't be hard
- i have no art yet :3 i'll get to it eventually
